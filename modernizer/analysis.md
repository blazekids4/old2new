# Code Analysis

This code is for a simple PHP-based web game called "Alphabet Slots" version 0.1, simulating a classic 3-reel, 3-line slot machine, akin to those found in casinos. The game allows players to place bets, spin the reels, and aims to match symbols according to a predefined pay table to win credits. The theoretical return to the player is mentioned as 96.5%, which indicates the game is designed to pay back that percentage of wagered money over an extended period.



### Key Features of the Code:



1. **Initial Configuration**:

    - Player's balance and the number of lines they wish to play (1 or 3) are received via GET parameters. Defaults are 100 credits for balance and 3 lines if no parameters are provided.

    - Error handling ensures:

        - Only 1 or 3 lines can be played.

        - The player has enough balance to cover their chosen number of lines.



2. **Reels Configuration**:

    - The slots machine consists of 3 reels, each with a predefined distribution of symbols (A, B, C, Z, D, X, Y) represented by numbers (0-6). Each reel's symbol distribution is slightly different.

    - These arrays are shuffled to simulate spinning reels.



3. **Spinning and Results**:

    - The player's balance is adjusted to account for the bet (reducing it by the number of lines played).

    - For each played line, the spun result (the first 3 symbols from the shuffled reels) is analyzed.

    - Background colors are used to indicate unplayed (grey), played (white), and winning lines (green shades).



4. **Payout Calculation**:

    - The payout is determined by matching the result against a defined pay table. Matches can range from specific three-of-a-kind combinations to having one or two of a certain symbol.

    - Winnings are added to the player's balance.



5. **Utilities Functions**:

    - `getSymbol(num)`: Converts numeric reel positions back to their corresponding symbols.

    - `getPayout(pl)`: Determines the payout based on the spun symbols for a playline.

    - `markPaytable(paytableamt, ptm)`: Checks whether a specific paytable amount has been awarded, marking it on the displayed pay table for player reference.



6. **Web Interface**:

    - An HTML form allows the player to submit their chosen bet (updating their balance and selecting 1 or 3 lines).

    - The outcome of each spin and the updated pay table, with any winnings marked, are displayed.



### Conclusion:



This game is a basic, interactive web application combining PHP for backend logic with minimal HTML for the user interface. It showcases fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, loops, functions, and conditional statements, along with basic web development techniques like handling GET parameters and dynamically generating HTML content based on PHP variables.
